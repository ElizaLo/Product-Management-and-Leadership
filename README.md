### Additional Product Strategy Practice Interview Questions

The best way to get better at Product Manager interviews is by actually doing them. You can practice by yourself out loud or even better with someone else. Here are some sample interview questions to get you started:

- How would you increase YouTube‚Äôs daily active users ?
- What are some ideas for improving mentorship on the LinkedIn platform?
- What is your favorite product and why?
- Start a new product category for Amazon -- what would you choose and why?
- If you want to launch a new social networking product, what are the primary considerations?

### Estimation

- **Learn hard facts:** I know I said you don‚Äôt need to know the answers to the questions, but let me rephrase that. While you don‚Äôt need to memorize the answers, it‚Äôs crucial to know certain ubiquitous numbers. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre interviewing for Google. What is the market share of Google Search? How much of the pie does Google Cloud Platform have? What was Google‚Äôs revenue and profit in 2017? Knowing these numbers, and more, helps more than you‚Äôd think. [To make your life easier, here is a short (and shabby) fact sheet I created while preparing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K9vukl5730pxl-n8jR9Xu0X1FXMf5Dk4dGee3_RiDVQ/edit?usp=sharing).

### Technical

- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** _GeeksforGeeks_ was my best friend here. I went through all the [sorting algorithms](https://betterexplained.com/articles/sorting-algorithms/) and basic [data structures](https://medium.com/swlh/introduction-to-data-structures-9134b7d064a6) used. Also brush up your CS fundamentals: OOPS concepts, [Networking frameworks](https://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/OSI_Layers.asp), how internet works, how WiFi works, what are the different protocols used and so on. Remember, you have to be so well-versed such that you can explain all this even to a 5 year old. To make lives easier, [here‚Äôs the word doc I used while preparing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BryNH_vXt7PU0I4zbKvDOkZHwDijvlJI/view?usp=sharing), use this and keep adding more.
- **System Design:** Ooh, we've hit bulls eye. Most people either don‚Äôt prepare or don‚Äôt prepare enough for this. Avoid that mistake, and use this [GitHub repo as your Bible or Quran or Bhagavad Gita](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer). Donne has done a brilliant job of breaking down everything needed. But no need to delve too deep; just practice the ten example questions given first.
- **Pseudocoding:** _Leetcode_ and a brilliant engineer friend of mine were my strongest pillars. I did not spend a lot of time here, as I knew they wouldn‚Äôt ask anything too crazy. If you‚Äôre well versed with coding, this should not be a hard section. Just make sure to enunciate, brute force first, optimize next and check for edge cases. [This YouTube channel by Kevin Naughton is super, super useful](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKvwPt6BifPP54yzH99ff1g).

### Additional Technical Practice Interview Questions

The best way to get better at Product Manager interviews is by actually doing them. You can practice by yourself out loud or even better with someone else. Here are some sample interview questions to get you started:

- You are part of the Google Search web spam team. How would you detect duplicate websites?
- What are some of the technical challenges with building a system to help restaurants receive orders electronically?
- Facebook recently identified that mobile app users in 3rd world countries with significantly lower bandwidth have a poor user experience. How would you reduce bandwidth consumption across Facebook‚Äôs mobile app?
- If you were the Product Manager for Gmail, how would you reduce the storage size on Gmail servers?
- How do you monitor performance and measure success of a recently launched product/service ?
- How do you gain credibility from the development / engineering teams as a new product manager?
- What is the importance of engineering and technical teams as stakeholders ? How do you integrate them into the overall product vision?

### Behavioral

- There are [multiple sites that give you example behavioral questions](https://www.quora.com/What-are-frequently-asked-questions-in-product-manager-interviews), but at the least, cover the basics: _Why you? Why this company? Why this role? What‚Äôs your expectation? What‚Äôs your biggest success? What‚Äôs your biggest failure? and How do you cope with a bad manager?_

### Key Takeaways

**Consider the following best practices:**

1. **Clearly define the problem and the objectives**
    - Make sure you understand the problem upfront. Candidates will sometimes latch on to a small part of the prompt that they heard and spend a lot of time going down an obscure path.
    - You should restate the problem and your assumptions about that problem in your own words and confirm it with the interviewer.
    - State any key assumptions you are making and ask follow up questions to clarify.
2. **Start with user needs**
    - No matter the type of problem, keep the needs of your users first.
3. **Communicate your approach and provide some structure**
    - Think and communicate how you are going to structure the problem before diving into it. The primary goal of case questions is to evaluate your problem solving process and abilities, not to evaluate whether you got to the correct answer. In many cases, there is no single correct answer.
    - Creating some structure around the problem is not only a good way to demonstrate that this is how you approach problems, but it is also a helpful interview tool. If you start by outlining your approach, you are less likely to forget to cover a certain aspect.
4. **Have a clear methodology**
    - There are many prioritization models out there (e.g. the RICE model). Find one or two that resonate with you and be prepared to use them, since prioritization questions are quite common in Product Manager interviews.
5. **At each part of the problem, start broad and then narrow in**
    - At each part of the process that you‚Äôve structured, start by brainstorming several different options, and then use some stated criteria to prioritize and narrow in.
    - You want to make sure you consider a wide range of options and show that you can think creatively, but also that you know when to focus on the most promising option. Both are critical parts of the product management process.
6. **State your approach at the outset**
    - Structure is critical - provide some outline upfront for how you plan to attack the problem.
7. **Gain familiarity of common technical solutions**
    - It‚Äôs valuable to have a basic architectural understanding of some well known products -- for example Google Search and Facebook Newsfeed.
8. **Understand the differences between mobile and desktop applications**
    - In preparation for your interview, review the key differences and considerations when building an application for mobile vs desktop. This is particularly important if the company you are interviewing with has a mobile product.
9. **Study the technology of the company you are interviewing with.**
    - Prior to the interview, gain a basic familiarity with the company‚Äôs key technology. This preparation will not only help you answer questions you are asked, but can also inspire questions for you to ask the interviewer.
 
### Prioritization 

There are many factors that can go into prioritization. Some common ones includes: 
1) Engineering Effort 
2) Revenue Impact 
3) Customer Satisfaction 
4) Competitive Advantage 
5) Mission Alignment

### Also

- **Stock options:** If you‚Äôre in the US, working for a startup, you need to know about how companies are funded and how stock options work. That‚Äôs tricky territory not easy to explain in a summary other than to say ‚Äúget clued up about finance because it‚Äôs your money and future we‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù Regardless of gender, ignorance is not cool. If you‚Äôre curious about the employer perspective on stock options for employees, I recommend Fred Wilson‚Äôs [MBA Mondays](http://avc.com/archive/#mba_mondays_archive) posts from back in 2010, particularly the ones on [‚ÄúHow Much?‚Äù](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-how-much/), [Vesting](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-vesting/), [Restricted Stock and RSUs](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-restricted-stock-and-rsus/) and [Options](http://avc.com/2010/10/employee-equity-options/).
- **For all other negotiations (money, time, flexibility):** I found that [Josh Doody](http://www.joshdoody.com/) had some helpful advice for how to think about negotiations. His newsletters are informative but you can [read his book too](https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step-step/dp/0692568689).
- **For women in particular**, Anna Marie Clifton wrote a long post about how [she negotiated for an additional $15,000 at Yammer](https://medium.com/we-are-yammer/how-i-negotiated-for-an-additional-15-000-at-yammer-2d3c137623ec). [Silence](https://www.fastcompany.com/3049676/a-womans-most-powerful-salary-negotiation-tool-silence) can be a great ally in negotiations, and it‚Äôs useful to learn how to wield it.

## Advice for someone interested in getting into Product Management:

- **Talk to other Product Managers:** It's valuable to hear a first hand perspective -- what they enjoy, the biggest challenges, etc.
- **Ask yourself why:** It's important to do some introspection on your motivations for being a Product Manager and why you believe the role is the right one for you.
- **Mentorship is key:** When evaluating job opportunities, take into consideration the expected level of mentorship and guidance you can receive from an experienced Product Manager at the company.

## The top qualities interviewers look for in Product Manager candidates:

- **Passionate:** Does the candidate truly care about the users and the problems they are trying to solve? Candidates who are excited and energized about solving hard problems are going to be more successful.
- **Problem Solver:** A skilled problem solver is comfortable taking a large problem and breaking it down into smaller ones.
- **Strong Communicator:** A Product Manager has many audiences -- it's critical to know how and what to communicate depending on who you are talking to.
- **Self-Starter:** A successful Product Manager takes initiative -- one who not only identifies problems but takes the next step of trying to solve it. A Product Manager's role is filled with ambiguity, and it's important for individuals to have the mindset to just figure things out.

## Common types of questions you may get in a Product Manager interview:

- **Behavior Questions:** These are extremely common and intended to assess your skills as a Product Manager based on your prior experiences and background. Know your resume really well so you can speak to any part of it. It's also a good idea to be prepared with a few projects or products you worked on that you are most comfortable talking about.
- **Case Study Questions:** These can take different forms but are usually Strategy, Design, or Technical or some combination of the three. Practicing example case questions will prepare you to be more comfortable and confident answering these types of open-ended questions. Check out Lessons 2 and 3 from this course to review case study interviews in more detail.

## Some tips on how to stand out in a Product Manager interview:

- **Use the STAR:** When answering a behavioral question, such as describing a problem you solved, consider the STAR Method to structure your answer:
  - **S**ituation : Provide context for the problem
  - **T**ask : Explain what needed to be done
  - **A**ction: Describe specifically what you did
  - **R**esults: Explain the ultimate outcome
- **Remember to demonstrate learnings:** Often, more important than the ultimate outcome is what you learned along the way that helped you grow as a Product Manager. Make sure to highlight this when discussing your experiences.
- **Always break down the problem:** Candidates who provide some clarity and structure to open-ended questions will stand out.
- **Above and beyond:** It's not always practical or appropriate, but to really stand out, consider creating a product related proposal or project that is beneficial to the company and provide this as part of the interview process.

# Growth Product Manager

Growth Product Manager is a relatively new role within the Product Management domain. Some aspects of a Growth Product Manager role that are unique and exciting:
- **Tinkering is key:** Growth Product Managers are constantly trying new experiments, testing new ideas, and doing many of these at once.
- **New experiments more than new features:** Growth Product Managers focus on how to get more customers to use existing features. A major challenge is identifying and experimenting new ways for customer adoption.
- **Quantity, not just quality:** Sometimes in Product Management, the focus will be on building a small set of very high quality features to address customer needs. As a Growth Product Manager, quantity is critical -- you need to test a lot of ideas at once.

# VP of Product

Examples of her day-to-day role as the VP of Product, including:
- Morning review of emails to identify which need urgent attention
- Looking at product metrics to see the direction her products are headed
- Structuring her day to spend time on day-to-day tactical work as well as long term strategic thinking
- Balancing the various requests that come to her (e.g. production bugs, sales team requests, customers feature requests, etc)

# Soft-skills for Manager

## Essential Feedback

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/Product-Management/main/img/feedback.png" width="900" height="100">

> Feedback is the process of helping others gain self-awareness about their actions and their impact

The focus of feedback should be to help others to thrive. Good feedback speeds up learning and builds collaborative and engaged teams.

Quality feedback speeds up learning, improves collaboration and increases engagement.

A way to think about feedback that avoids this is as **'reinforcing'** or **'redirecting'**. In this framing, all feedback is positive.

**Reinforcing feedback** is when your feedback encourages someone to continue a certain behavior.

Alternatively, **redirecting feedback** encourages someone to adopt a new behavior in favour of an old one.

In both cases, the focus is to help a person to thrive. Criticism on its own is not feedback.

### Tips for positive feedback.

Whether your feedback is reinforcing or redirecting, your focus should be on helping a person to improve. To do that it is important to ask yourself:

- What is my intention in giving this feedback?
- What impact do I want my feedback to have?
- Is my feedback constructive?
- Is my feedback actionable?

Take the _'blur'_ out of your feedback.

1. **Micro-yes:** get buy-in and prepare the individual for the conversation. For example, "Can I share feedback with you about X?"
2. **Data:** provide a specific data point. For example, "I noticed yesterday that you did X."
3. **Impact:** explain the impact on you or others. For example, "I mention it because as a result, Y happened."

### Structure feedback

Giving feedback without thinking it through can result in a confusing mess.

You can give structure to your feedback by using the LifeLabs Learning **‚ÄòBIQ method‚Äô**. **BIQ** stands for **_Behavior, Impact and Question_**. The BIQ method is super useful for both performance reviews and informal feedback conversations.

- **Behavior**: What did you actually see? Don't make assumptions about intent.
- **Impact statement**: What was the consequence? Why does it matter and who was affected?
- **Question**: What question do you want to ask to open the dialog?

Focussing on specific behaviors reduces ambiguity, sharing the impact gives understanding, and asking a question opens the dialog for real change to happen.

### So you've planned your feedback and you're ready to share it, but is it the right time for them?

**Rule of thumb:** When it comes to feedback, especially redirecting feedback, avoid surprises.

**The fix:** ask permission first.

Asking permission gives others a say in when they receive feedback. This has several benefits:
- Prepares them to be open to your feedback
- Shows your intention is to help
- Ensures enough time and space for a full conversation

When you ask for permission, be specific about what you'd like to share. For example:
- ‚ÄúCan I share some feedback with you about our meeting earlier today?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDo you have 10 minutes today to debrief on the presentation this morning?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI noticed a few things that might improve your presentation. Would you like me to share them with you?‚Äù

To avoid making assumptions, focus on behaviors you can observe. For example:
- ‚ÄúIn the team meeting yesterday, you were giving short answers.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI noticed that you didn't finish that task on time.‚Äù

This makes it much easier for the person to understand what triggered your feedback. It allows them to explain what they were thinking or feeling so you don't have to guess.

### Is it possible to give too much feedback?

Feedback is important for your team's growth, but too much too fast can be overwhelming. It's a lot to take in and makes it harder to act on it in a constructive way.

Counteract this by prioritizing your feedback. Focus on what will have the most impact on people‚Äôs success.

Focusing on 1 or 2 feedback areas at a time will give them space to absorb it and respond constructively.

If you're unsure about what feedback will be most impactful, just ask! For example, before giving feedback on a document, you might ask:
_"Are you looking for feedback on the strategic direction? Or more on spelling and grammar?"_

### Conclusions 

- Communicating data-driven feedback to reinforce or redirect behavior
- Separating the person from the problem to increase openness
- Asking questions to generate a genuine conversation
- Seeking to understand feedback rather than responding defensively.

## Ideas to improve on Feedback

Deliver effective feedback to your team members that allows them to understand it, reflect on it, and learn from it to make change for the better.

**Feedback is the process of helping others gain self-awareness about their actions and their impact**

Quality feedback speeds up learning, improves collaboration and increases engagement.

|**Reflection moments**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Team reflections at the end of meetings and projects</p><p>**Build time into the end of meetings and projects for all team members to reflect on the process.**</p><p>For a team meeting, when announcements are made or decisions agreed, ask them to spend 5 minutes reflecting on the process of the meeting and how communication went. For larger projects use a tool like [GroupMap](https://www.groupmap.com/) to take the team through an hour long process.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>These moments of reflection are a great way to evaluate success, gather feedback to share, and take on learnings. The team can implement changes for future projects and use for individual development.</p><p>**Instructions**</p><p>Great questions to ask and discuss include:</p><li>What went well that we'd do again?</li><li>What can improve for next time?</li><li>Anything we're still unsure of or need clarity on?</li><li>Are there action/s to take from this feedback?</li></ul>|
|**Break up triangulation**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Encourage direct feedback on your team</p><p>**Triangulation happens when someone offers second-hand feedback.**</p><p>This scenario is common among individuals or teams who are not comfortable sharing feedback directly e.g. _"A tells B about something that C did, and B delivers the feedback to C."_ And, if not handled well, triangulation can quickly escalate to distrust, disengagement, and a toxic work culture.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>When a recipient doesn‚Äôt know the feedback source, the message is typically too vague to be helpful. Worse yet, the recipient is often left feeling frustrated and anxious, wondering who said something behind their back and why the message wasn't delivered directly.</p><p>**Instructions**</p><p>Let your team know that you do not support triangulation, and ask everyone to hold one another accountable to giving feedback directly. If someone brings you feedback about someone else:</p><li>**Redirect:** Ask _"Have you shared this feedback directly?"_ If not, ask: _"How can I help you prepare for the conversation?"_ In the case of conflict, offer to mediate the conversation.</li><li>**Credit the source:** If the indivudual is unwilling to share, ask: _"If I deliver this message, can I let the person know they can follow up with you if they have any questions about the feedback?"_</li><li>**Collect the data:** If the individual is still uncomfortable sharing the message, say: _"In that case, I will keep an eye out for this behavior, so I can share the feedback from my perspective."_</li><p></p><p>**Pro tip:** [Learn more](https://lifelabslearning.com/lab/tripped-up-by-triangulation-heres-the-right-way-to-handle-third-party-feedback/) about not getting tripped up in triangulation.</p></ul>|
|**Establish feedback norms**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Set expectations with your team about how and when to share feedback</p><p>**Share why you think feedback is important.**</p><p>In your next team meeting and in your 1 on 1s, share why you think feedback is important e.g., _"when we give one another feedback, we help each other grow. Being direct about what we think is going well and not so well is the most helpful thing we can do for one another‚Äù_. Invite your team to give you feedback, and ask them to share their feedback preferences. Bonus: ask each direct report what they'd like you to give them feedback on.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>Feedback expectations vary widely by culture and by individual. Without shared feedback norms, miscommunication and conflict are likely to happen.</p><p>**Instructions**</p><p>At your next team meeting, share your commitment to creating a feedback culture. Ask team members to share their feedback preferences and capture your decisions in a team playbook. For example, answer the questions below together:</p><li>How often should we give one another feedback?</li><li>Should we share feedback in person, over email, Slack, etc.?</li><li>How often should we ask one another for feedback?</li><li>What types of things should we share feedback on?</li><li>How can we make it easy for people to give us feedback?</li><p></p><p>In your 1 on 1 meetings, ask each direct report about their feedback preferences and what they would like you to give them feedback on.</p></ul>|
|**Elephants, Dead Fish and Vomit**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Categorizing better dialogue in meetings</p><p>**Arrange your conversations in a way that makes everyone feel heard.**</p><p>After receiving survey feedback that employees didn't feel they could be open and honest, the Airbnb executive team categorized their dialogue in meetings under three areas: _'elephants'_, _'dead fish'_ and _'vomit'_.</p><li>**Elephants:** 'big things' in the room nobody is talking about</li><li>**Dead fish:** 'things' from the past people can't let go of</li><li>**Vomit:** is for situations when someone just needs to be heard.</li><p></p><p>_Why?_</p><p>Improve meeting effectiveness with clearly-defined opportunities to contribute on what often goes unsaid in organizations out in the open.</p><p>**Instructions**</p><li>Ask your team if they feel this type of meeting methodology could help get better clarity and talk about situations more openly.</li><li>Facilitate for meetings when this is appropriate.</li></ul>|
|**Timing is everything**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Providing feedback in the moment or as close to it.</p><p>Timely feedback increases the chances of people being more aware of their performance and being able to make changes. Whether the feedback is positive or constructive, provide the information as closely tied to the event as possible. Within 24 hours is ideal.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>Normalizing feedback as part of everyday conversation on what people are doing well or areas for improvement vs. waiting for a formal review helps it be better received.</p><p>**Instructions**</p><li>Look for opportunities to recognize great performance, it's a powerful motivator. Recognition fosters more of the appreciated actions.</li><li>Pull aside a team member in private for any constructive feedback, ask permission first and look to work on a solution together.</li><li>Look to make this feedback timely, specific and frequent for your team members.</li></ul>|
|**Feedback loops**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Team speed is a function of the frequency and quality of its feedback loops.</p><p>**Don‚Äôt use smart goals, OKRs, or similar mechanisms as the only way to create focus.**</p><p>Instead, [inspire the team with questions that frame its goals as challenges to be solved](https://hbr.org/2017/10/there-are-two-types-of-performance-but-most-organizations-only-focus-on-one), and then solve those challenges through constant experimentation. That is the only way to make decisions both quickly and effectively.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>Imagine you‚Äôre driving a car down a windy road. Now imagine that you‚Äôre only allowed to touch the steering wheel once every ten minutes. How fast would you drive the car? Most people would say, ‚Äúreally slowly!‚Äù In this sense, your team is just like a car: [in order to move fast, you need frequent, high-quality feedback loops](https://hbr.org/2018/08/how-to-motivate-frontline-employees).</p><p>**Instructions**</p><p>Take the following steps to implement fast feedback loops:</p><li>Articulate your team's strategic objectives as **_challenges_**, aka questions to be answered.</li><li>Establish a weekly routine of running experiments as a team to solve your challenges.</li><li>At the beginning of each weekly meeting, share context in the form of stories and metrics to see how the last week's experiments affected performance.</li><li>Given your current context, ideate on and agree to your next set of experiments.</li><li>Every month, reflect on your pace of experimentation. How many experiments did you run? Were they enough? How can you free up more time for experimentation? Or, how can you make each experiment faster and more efficient?</li></ul>|
|**Provide direct and helpful feedback**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Be direct and constructive, so feedback come across clearly and respectfully</p><p>**Offer direct and helpful feedback for improvement.**</p><p>Attempting to soften a point when addressing tough or sensitive issues can result in misunderstandings. Tools like the 'feedback sandwich' have steered people off track by offering compliments on either side of bad news, and people misinterpreting what was intended.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>Being direct, constructive, and straightforward with your message and its importance will be interpreted clearly and respectfully.</p><p>**Instructions**</p><li>Let your team member be aware you'd like to offer them some feedback for improvement.</li><li>Ensure you have clear examples of the behavior and it's impact, and how it's not useful in the situation.</li><li>Allow them time and space to hear the feedback, and to respond with their understanding of the situation and offer some insight into how or why it's occurring and solutions to prevent it in the future.</li><li>If required, offer examples of constructive ways of working they could adopt to prevent this happening in the future.</li><li>Agree what you both feel success would look after this conversation.</li><li>Agree to check in again within a 2 week period re progress, and again in 4 weeks as a measure of change.</li></ul>|
|**What you say vs. how you say it**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è How you say something often has more impact than what you're saying</p><p>**It's not what you say, it's how you say it that often leaves more of an impact.**</p><p>Messages we send are often misinterpreted. This can be based on the words we have used, the behaviors or mannerisms we exhibit, and the tone being misread.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>Some research suggests that when people are interpreting one another's communication they observe it broken down as: 7% is the words we speak, 38% is the tone we use (how you use your voice) and 55% is our body language and mannerisms. A lot of this interpretation is believed to be sub-conscious and automatic.</p><p>**Instructions**</p><p>Next time you have a colleague/ customer come towards you, consider how you can adjust your posture, facial expression and tone to have a more open-style approach.</p><li>Consider the impact of the way you hold yourself can have.</li><li>An open approach can see a better outcome with others.</li><li>Try softer eye contact, arms relaxed by your side (uncrossed), smiling, turning to face people, tilting your head or softening your voice.</li></ul>|
|**Re-think your feedback cadence**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Increase the cadence of feedback for employees</p><p>An example of this is to abandon performance ratings and create a more frequent and feedback-focused performance management process. Every quarter, every employee can sit down with their manager to give and receive feedback and discuss goals from the quarter prior and upcoming quarter. They can also discuss career pathing.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>By increasing the cadence for feedback, you can ensure a regular discussion and status updates of how employees are feeling, and how they‚Äôre progressing against goals.

## Strategic Thinking

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/Product-Management/main/img/Strategic_thinking.png" width="900" height="100">

Strategic thinking is a process that enables you to work with your team on plans to achieve your goals. Strategic thinking is a skill built through experience and observation.

The key thing that great strategic thinkers do differently is that they pause (even if just for a minute) to think about how they are thinking. They pause to define terms, to contemplate what matters most, to create measurables, and to think about context, including asking, "Wait, what do we mean by this term?"

Developing this type of thinking depends on focusing on trends, challenging the norm, provoking different perspective, questioning assumptions and reading between the lines - all aspects that take time and determination to practice.

Develop these skills to make better decisions in the face of uncertainty.

### Structuring skills

**Structuring skills:** the ability to create structure even when something is vague. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The tool? Gap analysis and scaling questions.

#### Scaling Questions

Some common scaling questions to get you started:

- **Completion:** How complete is the project I‚Äôm working on, 1-10 scale? What would move it one point?
- **Efficiency:** How streamlined is xyz currently? Where would I (realistically) like it to be by now? What would move it one point?
- **Satisfaction:** How happy am I with how things are going?
- **Impact:** How successful is xyz?
- **Skill level:** How skilled am I at xyz?

These are just a few sample questions. The key point is to train the brain to think in terms of numbers.

**Why practice scaling questions?**

Researchers at LifeLabs Learning studied the difference between good and great managers. They saw one key difference between them: the great managers had a habit of helping their teams think in concrete, measurable ways, even when things don't seem measurable. Adding numbers creates both a reality check and a relative progress bar to track change against.

So, teams with great strategic thinking skills have a habit of asking:

- Where things currently are
- Where one would like those things to be by a certain date
- What actions move the needle between those two points.

#### Gap Analysis

**Spread the gap analysis habit to your team.**

When managers ask their direct reports gap analysis questions, strategic thinking skills spread. They soon become part of the team‚Äôs way of communicating. This starts to happen even when their manager isn‚Äôt around. Sounds small, but makes a big difference.

Your mission in the next few days is to find a way to ask your direct reports a gap analysis question. Choose one of these or create your own:
- How are things currently going with [xyz project], 1-10 scale? What would move it one point?
- How satisfied are you with [the amount of feedback you are getting]? What would move it one point?
- How would you rate the usefulness of our 1-on-1s? What would move it one point?
- How clear do you feel about your priorities? What would move it one point?

That‚Äôs a wrap on first strategic thinking habit: **asking gap analysis** or **scaling questions**.

#### 'Red flags'

Awareness of common red flags means you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Pausing to think about the common mistakes - the red flags - will build awareness of your team‚Äôs habits. This creates what researchers call ‚Äòcontextual cueing‚Äô for managers. You‚Äôll begin to sense when a team member is about to make a strategic mistake, and can then take action to avoid it.

In 1-on-1s or team meetings this week, begin asking your team questions like those:
- What strategic thinking habits matter most for our team, in your opinion?
- What are the most common strategic thinking mistakes you/we make?
- When don‚Äôt we think strategically as a team?
- What conditions create strategic mistakes?

Building awareness about strategic capacity is a great thing for a team.

Research shows that teams who think strategically have a habit of thinking about the whole picture of a problem. They think about a full range of potential factors that may be contributing to it.

In doing so, great strategic thinkers create solutions that last, rather than solutions that are short-sighted.

### Contextualizing skills

**Contextualizing skills:** the ability to look at the full picture before diving into the wrong solution. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The tool? 3-lens analysis.

#### ‚Äò3-lens analysis‚Äô

Here‚Äôs how it works. Think about a project that someone is working on now and struggling with.

Now, take 1 minute to look at this problem with different lenses. Flip through each lens (imagine the lenses eye doctors use when testing your vision):

- **Lens 1: The person**

In what ways (if any) might the individual be contributing to the problem? (Things like their workstyle, lack of skill, motivation, clarity.)

- **Lens 2: You**

In what ways (if any) might you be contributing to the problem? (Maybe you didn‚Äôt provide feedback, didn‚Äôt set clear expectations.)

- **Lens 3: The team/ organisation**

In what ways (if any) might the team/organisation/systems be contributing to the problem? (Things like interdependencies, unclear processes, conflicting priorities.)

This 3 minute exercise of **_‚Äòflipping through 3 lenses‚Äô_** helps train the brain to think through the many potential causes of a problem.
This is what psychologists call **_‚Äòmultivariate thinking'_**. It means you can fix the problem - strategically - for the long haul.

Find a way to plant 3-lens questions into your 1-on-1s. Common questions you can ask direct reports are:
- Should we look at this from different lenses?
- What other perspectives could we take on this?
- What are some other potential contributing factors we should consider?
- Should we do a quick 3-lens analysis on this before diving in?

Asking your team questions adds structure and context to a problem. With practice, team thinking can change.

Some common questions to try adding to your everyday conversations with your team:
- Let‚Äôs put some numbers on this! On a scale from 1-10, where are we at with xyz?
- What‚Äôs the gap here - where are we now and where do we want to be?
- What would create a 10% improvement? What would move us one point closer to our goal?
- Let‚Äôs pause here before diving in‚Ä¶ what lenses should we look at this problem from?
- What else do we need to consider?
- Should we do a 3-lens analysis on it, to make sure we‚Äôre working on the right fix?

### Prediction skills

**Prediction skills:** It‚Äôs the ability to think forward and anticipate issues before they come up.

#### UC stands for ‚ÄòUnintended Consequences‚Äô

Doing a UC check means you see potential problems before they happen.

- Imagine this:

A manager hops in to help direct reports rather than coach them. As an UC, direct reports don‚Äôt get to learn how to think more strategically about their own fixes. The manager is constantly needed and busy.

- Picture this:

A direct report cares so much about doing a great job and being a great contributor that they perfect their work before asking for any feedback. As an UC, people feel excluded from the process. Corrective feedback isn‚Äôt received on time. And the direct report feels surprised by reactions they didn't expect. The direct report would have been seen as a much more skillful contributor if they‚Äôd gotten feedback earlier, even with an imperfect draft. UC alert!

UC checking is the bread and butter of great strategic thinkers.

Try using the words ‚Äòunintended consequences check‚Äô at least once - even if in your own mind. Ask yourself:
- ‚ÄúShould I/we pause to do a quick UC check on that?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAre there any UCs I‚Äôm not thinking of?‚Äù

#### Pre-mortem

You may have heard about post-mortems. Post-mortems are done to figure out what caused something to fail. Post-mortems are done after a project is over.

In a pre-mortem, you flip the script. You think about an upcoming project that hasn‚Äôt yet happened, but imagine it completely failed. Now, you list reasons for why the project failed. Finally, you come up with mitigations to help reduce the chances of those things happening.

- Project or goal you have (you can also list a life goal).
- Imagine it failed. What caused it to fail? List a few ideas.
- What‚Äôs a 10% mitigation you could do to buffer against this happening?

What do pre-mortem questions look like in practice?

Pre-mortem questions aren‚Äôt hard and don‚Äôt need to be like a formula. The goal is only to have a habit of pausing to ‚Äòthink forward‚Äô. This means doing a quick check for potential risks and blockers, and then creating mitigations.

Here are some pre-mortem questions you could ask your team.

- Let‚Äôs pause for a moment and think forward: what could get in the way of this project going well?
- What might we be overlooking?
- Imagine that this project would fail. What would cause it to fail?
- What lack of information could set us back?
- What are some of the risks or challenges we might not be thinking about but should be?
- What‚Äôs one thing we can do to increase the chances of success by 10%?
- What are some mitigations we can do to prevent issues from happening?

With your team, share this: ‚ÄúOk team, let‚Äôs do a quick pre-mortem on this before we dive in. Imagine we are looking into a crystal ball, and this project has failed. It‚Äôs a mess. Now, everybody, take 2 minutes and write down all the reasons why you think the project failed.‚Äù

Collect the ideas, have the team vote on what they think the biggest risk is from the list. Then, brainstorm a list of mitigations for that top risk.


### Improve on Strategic Thinking

Work with your team to develop an agreed approach and plan towards achieving a desired outcome and goals. Build skills in critical thinking, analysis, creativity and innovation.

**Strategic thinking is a skill built through experience and observation**

Developing this type of thinking depends on focusing on trends, challenging the norm, provoking different perspective, questioning assumptions and reading between the lines - all aspects that take time and determination to practice.

## Productivity

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/Product-Management-and-Leadership/main/img/Productivity.png" width="900" height="100">

Knowing how to harness more productive ways of working is essential for all managers.

Manage your own and the team's workload and energy levels to maximize outputs, quality delivery and personal wellbeing.

The most common productivity challenges they face fall into 4 categories:
- Time awareness
- Prioritization
- Organization
- Focus

Understanding these categories will allow you to quickly diagnose and resolve issues for yourself and your team. You‚Äôll make your life easier, and become an even better manager faster.

### Time awareness

**Great managers communicate time differently.**

They model time integrity by being precise with their language. Your time awareness tool #1 is to use time language. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done.

- **Instead of saying:** ‚ÄúShall we move onto the last item on the agenda?‚Äù
    - **Say:** ‚ÄúIn our last 10 minutes, shall we move onto the last item on the agenda?‚Äù
- **Instead of saying:** ‚ÄúCan you send me that file ASAP?‚Äù
    - **Say:** ‚ÄúCan you send me that file by 3pm (EST)?‚Äù
- **Instead of saying:** ‚ÄúDo you have 2 seconds to chat about X?‚Äù
    - **Say:** ‚ÄúDo you have 15 minutes to chat about X?‚Äù
- **Instead of saying:** ‚ÄúThis needs to be done today.‚Äù
    - **Say:** ‚ÄúThis needs to be done by 6pm today.‚Äù

**Respecting time is as easy as choosing your words carefully.**

In these examples the great managers avoided using ‚Äòblurry‚Äô time language. These are things like ‚ÄòASAP‚Äô, ‚Äò2 seconds‚Äô or ‚ÄòEOD‚Äô. Instead they used clear and precise language. Doing so allowed them to get aligned, avoid misunderstanding, and show respect for their team's time.

**How will you clearly communicate time?**

To make a habit of using precise time language, you can share your commitment to ‚Äòtime integrity‚Äô. Try saying something like ‚ÄúI want to make an effort to be more precise in my communication around time‚Äù.

Or start ‚Äòdeblurring‚Äô or clarifying time words. For example, when someone asks you if you have ‚Äúone moment,‚Äù you can say: ‚ÄúI have 5 minutes right now or we can discuss it in our 1-on-1. Which do you prefer?‚Äù

If someone asks for a favor and promises that ‚Äúit will take you no time at all,‚Äù you can bring time awareness into the conversation.

Do this by saying, ‚ÄúI want to make sure I can follow through if I say yes. Can I ask some questions to make sure I have enough time to help?‚Äù

Do this by saying, ‚ÄúI want to make sure I can follow through if I say yes. Can I ask some questions to make sure I have enough time to help?‚Äù

As you go about your day, take the time to notice how the team is talking about time. When you see unclear time communication:

- Model ‚Äòtime integrity‚Äô by catching and ‚Äòde-blurring‚Äô your own time language
- Ask your team a time integrity question (for example, ‚Äúwhat does EOW mean to you?‚Äù)

**One of the most effective things a manager can do to create shared time awareness is to simply make sure meetings run on time.**

Starting and stopping meetings on time is your time awareness tool #2.

This behavior has a positive 'domino effect' on the rest of your organization. Doing it yourself spreads the habit. It also sends a signal that time integrity is a normal part of work rather than an occasional pleasant surprise.

**How to adopt the habit of running meetings on time.**

Before introducing changes into your meeting norms, set the context for your team. To ‚Äòframe‚Äô the conversation, you could say:

_‚ÄúTo model time integrity and respect your time, I would like to introduce a new norm of starting and stopping our meetings on time. Here‚Äôs what I was thinking [insert suggestion], and I would also love to hear from you and see what other ideas you have.‚Äù_

Now you have the context for the change, here are some tips to help you make it happen.

- Start on time, even if only a few participants are present
- Ask people to assign time estimates to each agenda item
- Choose a timekeeper and/or use an audible timer to keep everyone on track
- Put a clock in the room or add a countdown on the digital screen
- Lock the door (physically or digitally) when the meeting starts, making it impossible for late participants to join

2 ways to increase your team‚Äôs time awareness:

- Using precise time language
- Start/stopping meetings on time

**What does a time audit look like?**

Track your activities and their impact at 30-minute intervals. Track the time from when you get up to when you go to bed. You could do the audit throughout the day, at different points in the day, or at the end of the day.

You can choose one of the many time audit apps available or use a simple spreadsheet. In your audit you can track:
- The time period
- What you were doing
- If it was planned or reactive
- How it affected your energy levels (energised, neutral or drained)

Knowing exactly how you spend your time has real benefits.

While time audits call for deliberate action, the benefits are much greater than the effort invested. Time audits increase awareness of:
- Where your time goes
- What you‚Äôre doing with your time
- What tasks energize or drain you
- When are you most productive

When the team shares their insights with you, it‚Äôs a great coaching opportunity around time awareness.

Here‚Äôs some questions you could ask. Choose 1 or more of these questions to ask your team at the end of the audit.
- Did anything surprise you?
- Are there activities you should make sure you make time for in the future?
- Are there activities you can batch-process/consolidate to be more efficient?
- Are there certain times of the day you‚Äôre more productive than other times?
- Are some of us doing certain tasks much faster or slower?How can we learn from each other or better distribute responsibilities?

### Prioritization

#### 'MIT method‚Äô (most important tasks)

The basic idea is to start (or end) your day by writing down the 3 most important tasks you hope to accomplish in the next 24 hours.

**How hard is it to say ‚Äúno‚Äù?**

One of the great benefits of creating an MIT list is that it allows you not only to prioritize what‚Äôs most urgent and important, it also helps you stay disciplined. It becomes easier to say no to requests that are less of a priority.

**Spread the habit by asking your team to name their MITs, and do it often.**

To really make the most of the tool you can:
- ask about MITs as a coaching question in your 1-on-1s
- start daily team meetings with an MIT review
- use MITs as a tool to align on priorities with your team, manager, and other leaders across the organization.

In the morning, note down your 3 MITs and end your day by checking off your list and ceremoniously putting it in the trash.

#### Bucket Method

Creating ‚Äòbuckets‚Äô of work tasks helps your team make sense of all the things they need to do.
- First, encourage your team members to pick their main ‚Äòbucket‚Äô or area of focus for the quarter. These buckets are their main objectives. (Help them define them if needed.)
- Next, under each bucket have them outline what goals each bucket links to.
- Then, every day, have them fill in the tasks they need to complete to make progress in each bucket.

_**For example:_**

**Bucket 1: Build app**

- **Goals this quarter:** Add 3 new features
- **Tasks for today:** Interview sales team to understand client needs

**Bucket 2: Onboard new hires**

- **Goals this quarter:** 4 weeks to proficiency
- **Tasks for today:** Create checklist for first week of onboarding

**Bucket 3: Develop my team**

- **Goals this quarter:** Engagement score of 90%
- **Tasks for today:** Give feedback to each team member, announce shadowing program

**Coaching around the bucket method helps cement it in the working day.**

When you‚Äôve helped your team members create their buckets, get more out of this productivity tool faster by asking coaching questions. Choose 1 of the following example questions to ask your team.

- What are your buckets for this quarter?
- What made you choose these?
- How do you define success for each one?
- What percentage of your time has been going to each bucket?
- What else have you been doing other than work in these three buckets?
- Does it make sense to adjust your buckets or find ways to reduce or remove the other activities
- How can you push back on requests so it‚Äôs possible to stick to your priorities?

### Organization

####  ‚ÄòConsistent Capture System‚Äô or CCS

Encourage your team members to _‚Äòclose the loop‚Äô_.

When it comes to work, most people‚Äôs minds are full of _‚Äòopen loops‚Äô_. These are swirling reminders and snippets of information.

The solution to all these open loops is to encourage your team members to create a **‚Äòconsistent capture system‚Äô** or **CCS**. This is a concept inspired by author [David Allen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done). A CCS is a reliable, go-to place to record information instead of storing it in memory. The most important CCS types capture:
- To-do items
- Appointments
- Deadlines
- Notes (including key points, ideas, and instructions)

Your mission is to close the loop by committing to using a single CCS and embed the tool in your team.
- First, be sure to keep yourself organized and model good organization habits by having a CCS of your own. Write down and commit to a single tool to capture your to-do items.
- If your team members don‚Äôt already have a CCS, encourage them to experiment with options. They should pick the CCS that works best for their brains and stick to it.

Recording information in a single, reliable place may seem like a small thing. But it can have real impact.

The value of creating a great CCS for your team is that you can set their minds free. They‚Äôll be free to:
- solve problems
- detect patterns
- develop relationships
- generate new ideas

**Ask ‚Äòwho, what, where‚Äô questions and get commitments made.** 

Having a closed loop culture is especially useful in team meetings. It‚Äôs training your team to make a habit of asking closed loop questions like these:
- Who is capturing this?
- Who is owning this?
- Who else needs to be involved?
- What needs to be done?
- When does this need to get done?

Not only does a closed loop culture mean there‚Äôs shared accountability, it also saves the entire team time and frustration trying to remember who was responsible for what and when.


### Focus

**What is self-interruption?**

A self-interruption is a turn away from your workflow. This means things like checking email, texts, social media, starting new projects or getting a snack.

The result? Interruptions increase stress, errors and frustration. This leads to wasted time and worse performance.

How can you help your team reduce interruptions?

**Co-create ‚Äòif-thens‚Äô**

One solution to reduce internal and external distractions is to anticipate them in advance and create rules. These rules help you make your best intentions happen and automate your behavior. We call them simply: ‚Äòif-thens‚Äô.

Here‚Äôs how if-thens work.

1. Think of a distraction you want to avoid (for example, too many emails)
2. Select a behavior to counter it (batch processing emails)
3. Find an ‚Äòenvironmental prompt‚Äô (an action, time or place) to trigger the desired behavior. For example, if it‚Äôs 12pm, then I will batch process my emails for a half hour.

Instead of deciding in that moment how to handle a distraction, use your pre-programmed if-then to guide your actions.

**Here‚Äôs some examples:**

- **Distraction:** Social media
    - **If:** Open laptop in the morning
    - **Then:** Write down my MITs
- **Distraction:** Someone asks a quick question
    - **If:** Question is complicated
    - **Then:** Schedule a later time to discuss
- **Distraction:** Email notifications
    - **If:** Need to focus
    - **Then:** Turn off alert

#### Pomodoro technique

The tool‚Äôs name is the Italian word for tomato, and comes from its creator, Francesco Cirillo. It‚Äôs based on a tomato-shaped kitchen timer he used to stay focused on his work as a university student.

The Pomodoro technique means working within strict time limits. Here‚Äôs how it works.

- If the Pomodoro starts, then spend 25 minutes focused on a task.
- If 25 minutes pass, then take a mandatory five-minute break.
- If you get interrupted (or interrupt yourself), then you have to start over.

#### Kanban

This final productivity tool is great for helping your team improve focus, and can also improve time awareness, prioritization, and organization.

It‚Äôs a multifaceted tool that takes its name from the Japanese word for ‚Äòsign‚Äô (kanban). The Kanban system comes from the world of Toyota car manufacturing, where managers introduced visual signs to increase production efficiency.

<img src="https://github.com/ElizaLo/Product-Management-and-Leadership/blob/main/img/Kanban.png" width="313" height="281">

Kanban is a scheduling system that tracks the progress and ownership of tasks by moving cards through a series of columns.

- Each task is represented on a card. Cards start their journey in the ‚Äòbacklog‚Äô (or ‚Äòto do‚Äô) column.
- When you‚Äôre ready to begin working on a task, you move that card to the ‚Äòdoing‚Äô column.
- This simple action is at the heart of the Kanban System‚Äôs ability to generate focus. It‚Äôs an explicit agreement between you and your brain about the task you‚Äôll be working on until you‚Äôre ready to move it into the glorious ‚Äòdone‚Äô column.

### Improve on Productivity

Manage your own and the team's workload and energy levels to maximize outputs, quality delivery and personal wellbeing.

**Knowing how to harness more productive ways of working is essential for all managers**

Apply tested time management hacks, be aware of your impact on others, learn how to communicate priorities to your team and recognize how to optimize broken processes to strengthen skills in this area.

An example of a big rock could be launching a new product line, overhauling a process, hiring a new department lead, and even improving your own health and wellbeing.</p><p>Imagine your week is divided into seven buckets. If you fill each one up with little pebbles, grains of sand and whatever else comes your way without planning ahead, there will be no room for the "big rocks" (your priorities). Your buckets fill up faster than you know it, and once your buckets are full, you‚Äôre done. You can‚Äôt get bigger buckets. Often, these big rocks can get pushed back from week to week because we never have time to do them - our days fill up too quickly. To avoid this, it helps to get the important stuff done first.</p><p>If you are struggling to achieve the things that are most important:</p><li>Name your Three Big Rocks.</li><li>At the beginning of each week reflect on why you'll be proud to achieve them.</li><li>Block out time in your diary with things you can do towards achieving them, like a meeting, attending an event, writing a memo, delegating a task or reflective thinking.</li><li>Chip away at them each week and include stakeholders when necessary.</li></ul>|

Urgent tasks are the ones that need to be dealt with immediately. Important tasks are the ones that contribute to long-term missions and goals. We often allow urgent to trump important because of our own or others poor time management.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>Taking this approach allows you to be more efficient with your time. You have a limited amount of time in your week, so it is worth considering how you will set aside time for important tasks. You might need to set a deadline for tasks before they become urgent, and blocks of time to complete. Alternatively, you could try setting reminders or ask others to review the work so stick to deadlines.</p><p>**Instructions**</p><p>For each of the four quadrants of this matrix you can try a different approach:</p><li>**High Urgency/ High Importance:** **_DO_** tasks or often termed firefighting, meeting a deadline or approval before close of business.</li><li>**High Urgency/ Low Importance:** **_DELEGATE_** tasks and usually urgent due to the impact of others, like a team member missing a deadline putting everyone else behind or tasks that can be delegated like admin.</li><li>**Low Urgency/ High Importance:** **_DECIDE_** tasks often planning tasks like strategy presentations, research and consistency of looking after own wellbeing. Actively deciding when to start, update and complete these to ensure they are managing over time.

> The best managers don‚Äôt just run meetings, they design experiences.

Meetings are common and difficult. That‚Äôs why knowing how to lead them is one of the most powerful ways you can stand out as a manager.

### 4P Opener

| Title | Description |
| :---:         |          :--- |
|**‚ÄòP‚Äô** is **Purpose**|<ul><p>Purpose is why the meeting is happening. For example: _‚ÄúThe purpose of this meeting is to [**update, explore, decide...**]_‚Äù</p><p>This first P links up to the goal of the meeting, to make sure it‚Äôs a strategic use of time. Without a purpose statement, conversations will pull in different directions. This causes confusion, frustration and inefficiency. Clarifying purpose up front also helps participants focus on the topic at hand. It means they‚Äôre less likely to get distracted by thoughts from earlier meetings.</p></ul>|
|**‚ÄòP‚Äô** is **Product**|<ul><p>Product is what the group will have at the end of the meeting that didn‚Äôt exist at the start. For example: _‚ÄúWe will leave here with [**five ideas, a decision, a list of next steps...**]‚Äù_</p><p>We‚Äôve seen how purpose means there‚Äôs a broad focus area. Product creates a mental progress bar in everyone‚Äôs minds toward the ultimate result of this specific meeting.</p><p>The more tangible the product, the more likely people will be to hold each other and themselves accountable for staying on topic.</p></ul>|
|**‚ÄòP‚Äô** is **Personal benefit**|<ul><p>Personal benefit is the reason meeting participants will feel motivated to contribute. For example: _‚ÄúThis will help you/us [**save time, feel aligned, make an impact...**]‚Äù_</p><p>The personal benefit statement should spark motivation to achieve the product. Without an explicit personal benefit, it can be easy for people to ‚Äòcheck out‚Äô and become passive bystanders.</p><p>A personal benefit statement also gives you, as the meeting leader, an opportunity to link to why you‚Äôre passionate about this topic.</p><p>Research shows that the meeting leader‚Äôs mood at the start of a meeting spreads to the rest of the participants, whether it‚Äôs positive or negative. When you‚Äôre excited about the meeting topic, your team is more likely to get excited too!</p></ul>|
|**‚ÄòP‚Äô** is **Process**|<ul><p>Process means how we will structure the conversation. For example: _‚ÄúWe‚Äôll spend the first half on agenda point X, and the second half on point Y.‚Äù_</p><p>Process outlines how the group will achieve the product. Ideally, this takes the form of an agenda shared in advance of the meeting and again at the beginning. Research shows that agendas rapidly improve meeting quality.</p><p>Now let‚Äôs look at how an agenda gives the structure your meeting needs.</p></ul>|

### Meeting Types

The most common meeting types are:
- üî∏ **Inform:** share information, news, thoughts, and/or feelings or answer questions
- üî∏ **Explore:** ask questions, generate ideas, spark insights
- üî∏ **Narrow:** debate, prioritize, vote, decide, work out a plan of action

### Agenda

The agenda is a tool to keep focus throughout the meeting.

- Make your agenda visible throughout the meeting
- Check off each item on the agenda as you complete it to spark more dopamine (the chemical released in the brain that makes you feel good)
- Write time estimates for each agenda item, then record how long each item actually took to build time awareness skills.

As well as the agenda, you can also clarify other process points for the meeting. These are things like ground rules and instructions for how to use any technology used in the meeting.

### üü† ‚ÄòInform‚Äô type meeting

#### üî∑ 1: Round-robins

A round-robin is a process of going around to hear from each person in the group. Round-robins are efficient because you don‚Äôt have to wait around and wonder who will speak next. They also help harness the collective wisdom of your team, instead of letting just a few voices run the show.

Research shows that when people take equal turns in a conversation, this leads to better team performance. This is more important for performance than even collective team member IQ! So, when you do round-robins, be sure to give everyone equal speaking time.

And a final tip from the professionals. Use a timer you can hear so people can track their own talking time, or use a video call plug-in that shows participants how long each person has been speaking.

#### Get people involved early and change the dynamics of the meeting

A round-robin is a helpful tool whenever you want to hear from everyone in the group, and it‚Äôs especially useful at the start of meetings. When you get people‚Äôs voices in the room early on, they‚Äôll be more likely to contribute throughout the meeting.

Here are some examples of common round-robin prompts we‚Äôve seen great managers use in their team huddles. Choose one question you could use for your next round-robin.

- [ ] What is one win, frustration, or learning from the past week/yesterday?
- [ ] What did you get done yesterday?
- [ ] What are you working on today / what are your top priorities?
- [ ] What are your roadblocks or obstacles?

#### üî∑ 2: Rotate roles

For regular meetings to give information, great managers ask team members to take turns leading. That way people don‚Äôt get stuck in a position of high power or low power. Common roles to rotate include:

- Facilitating
- Timekeeping
- Note-taking
- Sending minutes

Rotating roles gives everyone an opportunity to be visible and to share in administrative tasks. It teaches people to be better meeting participants by building empathy for all roles. As a bonus, each person brings their own ‚Äòflavor‚Äô to these roles, creating variety in what could otherwise become a monotonous meeting.

#### üî∑ 3: Shorter meetings

A fun ‚Äòlaw‚Äô of meetings is Parkinson's Law which states that work expands to fill the time allotted to it.

If you‚Äôre meeting for an hour, experiment by reducing it to 55 or 50 minutes. If you‚Äôre meeting for half an hour, reduce it to 25 minutes. Besides giving people more free time (they will love you), shortening the meeting time creates a little bit of extra stress which focuses the mind.

### üü† ‚ÄòExplore‚Äô type meeting

We've seen how **‚ÄòInform‚Äô** meetings are all about a simple exchange of information. The purpose of **‚ÄòExplore‚Äô** meetings is to generate new insights and ideas together. Over the years, these types of meetings have become more popular. But sadly, research shows that they are usually less productive than coming up with ideas on your own.

So, how can you avoid the common pitfalls of these meetings and harness their power? First, make sure **you set aside time for silent**, **solo ‚Äòideation‚Äô (when you come up with ideas)**, as well as **ideation in a pair or whole group**.

#### üî∑ 1: Defer judgment

The number one rule for ideation is to defer judgment (which is different from ‚Äòno bad ideas‚Äô). Deferring judgment simply means you do not judge the merit of an idea during the brainstorming session.

Studies show that when we defer judgment we come up with more ideas and better ideas. Researchers at LifeLabs Learning observed that great managers reminded people to defer judgement. They did this even if they were generating ideas in silence (sometimes we can get in our own way).

And when exploring ideas out loud, they pointed out when participants were critical or even gave excessive praise. Doing this helps avoid switching on the group‚Äôs judgment filters.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Here's a sample of part of a conversation.**

**Explorer:** Oh! Another option we haven‚Äôt considered yet is changing our work hours.

**Narrower:** That would never work. People won‚Äôt agree to a different schedule.

**Meeting facilitator:** Whoops. That sounds like an evaluation of the idea. Can you hang onto that concern until we start narrowing down our options?

#### üî∑ 2: Idea quotas

Want an easy shortcut to helping people be less judgy? Assign an idea quota.

For example, set a goal of generating 10 ideas in 10 minutes or have teams compete over who will come up with more ideas. Paradoxically, a focus on quantity leads to higher quality. An idea quota also helps push people beyond boring, surface-level solutions. It keeps people digging even after they think their well of ideas has dried up.

#### üî∑ 3: Cross-pollinate

The enemy of exploration and ideation is ‚Äògroupthink‚Äô: going along to get along. The best managers recognized the power of bringing people with diverse backgrounds and views together. They made their exploration meetings better, faster, by deliberately cross-pollinating people‚Äôs perspectives. Just as cross-pollination gives life to brand new varieties of plants, it also gives life to brand new ideas.

To become a great cross-pollinator faster, get in the habit of asking questions to encourage looking wider.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Here are some samples.**

- Whose perspective might we be missing?
- Do we have enough diversity of people and perspectives in the room?
- What other people, departments, companies, industries, or even species have solved a similar problem?
- What can we learn from them?

### üü† ‚ÄòNarrow‚Äô type meeting

#### üî∑ 1: Declare the DACI

Many of the great managers LifeLabs Learning studied used some kind of decision-making framework with their teams. They did this both in general and especially during narrowing meetings. One of our favorites is the **‚ÄòDACI Model‚Äô**, which stands for:

- **Driver**: the person ‚Äòbehind the wheel‚Äô of an initiative who is responsible for getting it across the finish line. Just as in a car, there should only be one driver.
- **Approver(s)**: the person or people who make the final decision. Sometimes the Driver and Approver are the same person. If there are many approvers, make the approval process clear. _**For example**_: single approver, two approvers and a tie-breaker if needed, consensus (all agree to support the decision), majority vote (51%).
- **Consultants**: people who give input, suggestions, feedback, or execute components of the work.
- **Informed**: people who are updated along the way and when the work is done.


Without a clear Approver and Approval Process, debates can go on for some time and the loudest voices typically win out.

The beauty of DACI (and similar models) is that it helps you and your team make implicit (or unexpressed) expectations explicit.

To make an immediate improvement in the quality of your Narrow meetings, declare the DACI and Approval Process from the start.

#### üî∑ 2: Impact/Feasibility Map

When everyone is clear on how the decision will be made, it‚Äôs time to do the work of moving toward the decision. If you‚Äôve already generated a wide range of ideas, a helpful tool to narrow the list is an Impact or Feasibility Map.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

- Write each idea the team generated on a separate physical or digital ‚Äòsticky note‚Äô.
- Combine all the ideas.
- Remove any duplicates.
- Plot each idea on the spectrum of ‚Äòimpact‚Äô and ‚Äòfeasibility‚Äô.

Impact is how likely it will be that the idea achieves the desired result. Feasibility is how realistic it will be to act on this idea given existing constraints like time, money, and the team‚Äôs skill level.

_**For example**_:

In this chart, imagine your team‚Äôs goal is to double the number of attendees for the next conference.
- Idea A might be to invite an A-list celebrity. It would probably have a big impact, but it isn‚Äôt workable given your budget.
- Idea B might be to rename the conference. It would be easy, but it‚Äôs unlikely to have a significant impact.
- Idea C is the sweet spot (high impact and high feasibility), for example letting attendees buy a second ticket for 50% off.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/Product-Management/main/img/Impact_Feasibility_Map.png" width="329" height="276">

The goal of this exercise isn‚Äôt to have complete agreement or even to know for sure how to categorize each idea.

The point is to narrow your list of ideas down to those that are most likely to succeed and to hear people‚Äôs reasoning in the process.

While impact and feasibility are the most common criteria, you can also do this exercise with other criteria like:
- speed versus cost
- aesthetics versus functionality
- convenience versus environmental impact

The final tool for improving Narrow meetings keeps any conflicts that come up focussed on the ideas, not the people.

#### üî∑ 3: Pros, cons, and mitigations

After your long list dwindles down to a small list of workable, high impact ideas, it‚Äôs easy for debate to follow. When conflict is constructive it can be a terrific force for ensuring that decisions are thoughtful and strategic. But conflict can also easily turn personal. One of our favorite tools to keep conflict helpful is spelling out the pros, cons, and mitigations for each idea.

**From Me vs You, to Us vs the Problem**

The brilliance of this framework is that, instead of having people debate one another, you turn the team‚Äôs focus toward the ideas. Here‚Äôs how it works, one idea at a time:
- **Pros:** Going round-robin, each person shares what they see as the idea‚Äôs pros, strengths, and advantages.
- **Cons:** Each person shares what they see as the cons, risks, and disadvantages of the idea.
- **Mitigations:** Each person proposes mitigation suggestions to amplify the pros and reduce the impact of the cons.

### Course-correction formula

#### Behavior observation + impact statement + process suggestion

_For example_, if there is little discussion happening, you might say:

_‚ÄúIt seems we‚Äôre quiet today (**behavior observation**), which means it‚Äôs hard to tell if we‚Äôre aligned (**impact statement**). How about we take five minutes to brainstorm some questions in silence so we can all gather our thoughts, then share (**process suggestion**)?‚Äù_

- What would be your observation, impact and process statement if a few people are doing most of the talking?

_‚ÄúI‚Äôm noticing we‚Äôre not hearing from everyone, so we‚Äôre not getting the benefit of different perspectives. Let‚Äôs go round-robin (and say ‚Äúpass‚Äù if you prefer not to share).‚Äù_

- What would be your observation, impact and process statement if people are straying away from the topic?

_‚ÄúSince we only have 10 minutes left and this is our chance to make a decision that impacts all of us, should we go back to the agenda and add the other topic to the parking lot?‚Äù_

- What would be your observation, impact and process statement if people are shooting down one another ideas?

_‚ÄúIt looks like some of us are coming up with ideas and some of us are evaluating them, so we‚Äôre not making progress. Let‚Äôs defer judgement for this meeting, then we can look at pros and cons of each idea next week.‚Äù_

|[How Google Sold Its Engineers on Management](https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-google-sold-its-engineers-on-management)|High-performing knowledge workers often question whether managers actually contribute much, especially in a technical environment. Until recently, that was the case at Google, a company filled with self-starters who viewed management as more destructive than beneficial and as a distraction from ‚Äúreal work.‚Äù But when Google‚Äôs people analytics team examined the value of managers, applying the same rigorous research methods the company uses in its operations, it proved the skeptics wrong. Mining data from employee surveys, performance reviews, and double-blind interviews, the team verified that managers indeed had a positive impact. It also pinpointed exactly how, identifying the eight key behaviors of great Google managers. In this article, Harvard Business School professor Garvin describes how Google has incorporated the detailed findings from the research into highly specific, concrete guidelines; classes; and feedback reports that help managers hone their essential skills. Because these tools were built from the ground up, using the staff‚Äôs own input, they‚Äôve been embraced by Google employees. Managers say that they‚Äôve found their training to be invaluable, and managers‚Äô ratings from direct reports have steadily risen across the company.|
