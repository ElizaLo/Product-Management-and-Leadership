S, T, P, A, R refer to situation, task (or problem), action, result. Basically: some context, what was the problem, what did you do about it, and what happened? The **[pyramid principle](https://www.amazon.com/Minto-Pyramid-Principle-Writing-Thinking/dp/0960191038) developed by Barbara Minto**, a consultant, refers to grouping your answers into themes that are easier to digest.
- It also helps to know a few frameworks ‚Äî [3C, 4P, Porter‚Äôs 5 forces, Market Entry, etc at the back of your mind](http://www.streetofwalls.com/finance-training-courses/consulting-case-study-training/consulting-case-study-101-frameworks/).

### Additional Product Strategy Practice Interview Questions

The best way to get better at Product Manager interviews is by actually doing them. You can practice by yourself out loud or even better with someone else. Here are some sample interview questions to get you started:

- How would you increase YouTube‚Äôs daily active users ?
- What are some ideas for improving mentorship on the LinkedIn platform?
- What is your favorite product and why?
- Start a new product category for Amazon -- what would you choose and why?
- If you want to launch a new social networking product, what are the primary considerations?

### Estimation

- **Learn hard facts:** I know I said you don‚Äôt need to know the answers to the questions, but let me rephrase that. While you don‚Äôt need to memorize the answers, it‚Äôs crucial to know certain ubiquitous numbers. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre interviewing for Google. What is the market share of Google Search? How much of the pie does Google Cloud Platform have? What was Google‚Äôs revenue and profit in 2017? Knowing these numbers, and more, helps more than you‚Äôd think. [To make your life easier, here is a short (and shabby) fact sheet I created while preparing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K9vukl5730pxl-n8jR9Xu0X1FXMf5Dk4dGee3_RiDVQ/edit?usp=sharing).

### Technical

- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** _GeeksforGeeks_ was my best friend here. I went through all the [sorting algorithms](https://betterexplained.com/articles/sorting-algorithms/) and basic [data structures](https://medium.com/swlh/introduction-to-data-structures-9134b7d064a6) used. Also brush up your CS fundamentals: OOPS concepts, [Networking frameworks](https://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/OSI_Layers.asp), how internet works, how WiFi works, what are the different protocols used and so on. Remember, you have to be so well-versed such that you can explain all this even to a 5 year old. To make lives easier, [here‚Äôs the word doc I used while preparing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BryNH_vXt7PU0I4zbKvDOkZHwDijvlJI/view?usp=sharing), use this and keep adding more.
- **System Design:** Ooh, we've hit bulls eye. Most people either don‚Äôt prepare or don‚Äôt prepare enough for this. Avoid that mistake, and use this [GitHub repo as your Bible or Quran or Bhagavad Gita](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer). Donne has done a brilliant job of breaking down everything needed. But no need to delve too deep; just practice the ten example questions given first.
- **Pseudocoding:** _Leetcode_ and a brilliant engineer friend of mine were my strongest pillars. I did not spend a lot of time here, as I knew they wouldn‚Äôt ask anything too crazy. If you‚Äôre well versed with coding, this should not be a hard section. Just make sure to enunciate, brute force first, optimize next and check for edge cases. [This YouTube channel by Kevin Naughton is super, super useful](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKvwPt6BifPP54yzH99ff1g).

### Additional Technical Practice Interview Questions

The best way to get better at Product Manager interviews is by actually doing them. You can practice by yourself out loud or even better with someone else. Here are some sample interview questions to get you started:

- You are part of the Google Search web spam team. How would you detect duplicate websites?
- What are some of the technical challenges with building a system to help restaurants receive orders electronically?
- Facebook recently identified that mobile app users in 3rd world countries with significantly lower bandwidth have a poor user experience. How would you reduce bandwidth consumption across Facebook‚Äôs mobile app?
- If you were the Product Manager for Gmail, how would you reduce the storage size on Gmail servers?
- How do you monitor performance and measure success of a recently launched product/service ?
- How do you gain credibility from the development / engineering teams as a new product manager?
- What is the importance of engineering and technical teams as stakeholders ? How do you integrate them into the overall product vision?

### Behavioral

- There are [multiple sites that give you example behavioral questions](https://www.quora.com/What-are-frequently-asked-questions-in-product-manager-interviews), but at the least, cover the basics: _Why you? Why this company? Why this role? What‚Äôs your expectation? What‚Äôs your biggest success? What‚Äôs your biggest failure? and How do you cope with a bad manager?_

### Key Takeaways

**Consider the following best practices:**

1. **Clearly define the problem and the objectives**
    - Make sure you understand the problem upfront. Candidates will sometimes latch on to a small part of the prompt that they heard and spend a lot of time going down an obscure path.
    - You should restate the problem and your assumptions about that problem in your own words and confirm it with the interviewer.
    - State any key assumptions you are making and ask follow up questions to clarify.
2. **Start with user needs**
    - No matter the type of problem, keep the needs of your users first.
3. **Communicate your approach and provide some structure**
    - Think and communicate how you are going to structure the problem before diving into it. The primary goal of case questions is to evaluate your problem solving process and abilities, not to evaluate whether you got to the correct answer. In many cases, there is no single correct answer.
    - Creating some structure around the problem is not only a good way to demonstrate that this is how you approach problems, but it is also a helpful interview tool. If you start by outlining your approach, you are less likely to forget to cover a certain aspect.
4. **Have a clear methodology**
    - There are many prioritization models out there (e.g. the RICE model). Find one or two that resonate with you and be prepared to use them, since prioritization questions are quite common in Product Manager interviews.
5. **At each part of the problem, start broad and then narrow in**
    - At each part of the process that you‚Äôve structured, start by brainstorming several different options, and then use some stated criteria to prioritize and narrow in.
    - You want to make sure you consider a wide range of options and show that you can think creatively, but also that you know when to focus on the most promising option. Both are critical parts of the product management process.
6. **State your approach at the outset**
    - Structure is critical - provide some outline upfront for how you plan to attack the problem.
7. **Gain familiarity of common technical solutions**
    - It‚Äôs valuable to have a basic architectural understanding of some well known products -- for example Google Search and Facebook Newsfeed.
8. **Understand the differences between mobile and desktop applications**
    - In preparation for your interview, review the key differences and considerations when building an application for mobile vs desktop. This is particularly important if the company you are interviewing with has a mobile product.
9. **Study the technology of the company you are interviewing with.**
    - Prior to the interview, gain a basic familiarity with the company‚Äôs key technology. This preparation will not only help you answer questions you are asked, but can also inspire questions for you to ask the interviewer.
 
### Prioritization 

There are many factors that can go into prioritization. Some common ones includes: 
1) Engineering Effort 
2) Revenue Impact 
3) Customer Satisfaction 
4) Competitive Advantage 
5) Mission Alignment

### Also

- **Stock options:** If you‚Äôre in the US, working for a startup, you need to know about how companies are funded and how stock options work. That‚Äôs tricky territory not easy to explain in a summary other than to say ‚Äúget clued up about finance because it‚Äôs your money and future we‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù Regardless of gender, ignorance is not cool. If you‚Äôre curious about the employer perspective on stock options for employees, I recommend Fred Wilson‚Äôs [MBA Mondays](http://avc.com/archive/#mba_mondays_archive) posts from back in 2010, particularly the ones on [‚ÄúHow Much?‚Äù](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-how-much/), [Vesting](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-vesting/), [Restricted Stock and RSUs](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-restricted-stock-and-rsus/) and [Options](http://avc.com/2010/10/employee-equity-options/).
- **For all other negotiations (money, time, flexibility):** I found that [Josh Doody](http://www.joshdoody.com/) had some helpful advice for how to think about negotiations. His newsletters are informative but you can [read his book too](https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step-step/dp/0692568689).
- **For women in particular**, Anna Marie Clifton wrote a long post about how [she negotiated for an additional $15,000 at Yammer](https://medium.com/we-are-yammer/how-i-negotiated-for-an-additional-15-000-at-yammer-2d3c137623ec). [Silence](https://www.fastcompany.com/3049676/a-womans-most-powerful-salary-negotiation-tool-silence) can be a great ally in negotiations, and it‚Äôs useful to learn how to wield it.

## Advice for someone interested in getting into Product Management:

- **Talk to other Product Managers:** It's valuable to hear a first hand perspective -- what they enjoy, the biggest challenges, etc.
- **Ask yourself why:** It's important to do some introspection on your motivations for being a Product Manager and why you believe the role is the right one for you.
- **Mentorship is key:** When evaluating job opportunities, take into consideration the expected level of mentorship and guidance you can receive from an experienced Product Manager at the company.

## The top qualities interviewers look for in Product Manager candidates:

- **Passionate:** Does the candidate truly care about the users and the problems they are trying to solve? Candidates who are excited and energized about solving hard problems are going to be more successful.
- **Problem Solver:** A skilled problem solver is comfortable taking a large problem and breaking it down into smaller ones.
- **Strong Communicator:** A Product Manager has many audiences -- it's critical to know how and what to communicate depending on who you are talking to.
- **Self-Starter:** A successful Product Manager takes initiative -- one who not only identifies problems but takes the next step of trying to solve it. A Product Manager's role is filled with ambiguity, and it's important for individuals to have the mindset to just figure things out.

## Common types of questions you may get in a Product Manager interview:

- **Behavior Questions:** These are extremely common and intended to assess your skills as a Product Manager based on your prior experiences and background. Know your resume really well so you can speak to any part of it. It's also a good idea to be prepared with a few projects or products you worked on that you are most comfortable talking about.
- **Case Study Questions:** These can take different forms but are usually Strategy, Design, or Technical or some combination of the three. Practicing example case questions will prepare you to be more comfortable and confident answering these types of open-ended questions. Check out Lessons 2 and 3 from this course to review case study interviews in more detail.

## Some tips on how to stand out in a Product Manager interview:

- **Use the STAR:** When answering a behavioral question, such as describing a problem you solved, consider the STAR Method to structure your answer:
  - **S**ituation : Provide context for the problem
  - **T**ask : Explain what needed to be done
  - **A**ction: Describe specifically what you did
  - **R**esults: Explain the ultimate outcome
- **Remember to demonstrate learnings:** Often, more important than the ultimate outcome is what you learned along the way that helped you grow as a Product Manager. Make sure to highlight this when discussing your experiences.
- **Always break down the problem:** Candidates who provide some clarity and structure to open-ended questions will stand out.
- **Above and beyond:** It's not always practical or appropriate, but to really stand out, consider creating a product related proposal or project that is beneficial to the company and provide this as part of the interview process.

# Growth Product Manager

Growth Product Manager is a relatively new role within the Product Management domain. Some aspects of a Growth Product Manager role that are unique and exciting:
- **Tinkering is key:** Growth Product Managers are constantly trying new experiments, testing new ideas, and doing many of these at once.
- **New experiments more than new features:** Growth Product Managers focus on how to get more customers to use existing features. A major challenge is identifying and experimenting new ways for customer adoption.
- **Quantity, not just quality:** Sometimes in Product Management, the focus will be on building a small set of very high quality features to address customer needs. As a Growth Product Manager, quantity is critical -- you need to test a lot of ideas at once.

# VP of Product

Examples of her day-to-day role as the VP of Product, including:
- Morning review of emails to identify which need urgent attention
- Looking at product metrics to see the direction her products are headed
- Structuring her day to spend time on day-to-day tactical work as well as long term strategic thinking
- Balancing the various requests that come to her (e.g. production bugs, sales team requests, customers feature requests, etc)

# Soft-skills for Manager

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElizaLo/Product-Management/main/img/feedback.png" width="900" height="100">

## Essential Feedback

> Feedback is the process of helping others gain self-awareness about the impact of their actions.

The focus of feedback should be to help others to thrive. Good feedback speeds up learning and builds collaborative and engaged teams.

A way to think about feedback that avoids this is as **'reinforcing'** or **'redirecting'**. In this framing, all feedback is positive.

**Reinforcing feedback** is when your feedback encourages someone to continue a certain behavior.

Alternatively, **redirecting feedback** encourages someone to adopt a new behavior in favour of an old one.

In both cases, the focus is to help a person to thrive. Criticism on its own is not feedback.

### Tips for positive feedback.
Whether your feedback is reinforcing or redirecting, your focus should be on helping a person to improve. To do that it is important to ask yourself:

- What is my intention in giving this feedback?
- What impact do I want my feedback to have?
- Is my feedback constructive?
- Is my feedback actionable?

Take the _'blur'_ out of your feedback.

1. **Micro-yes:** get buy-in and prepare the individual for the conversation. For example, "Can I share feedback with you about X?"
2. **Data:** provide a specific data point. For example, "I noticed yesterday that you did X."
3. **Impact:** explain the impact on you or others. For example, "I mention it because as a result, Y happened."

### Structure feedback

Giving feedback without thinking it through can result in a confusing mess.

You can give structure to your feedback by using the LifeLabs Learning **‚ÄòBIQ method‚Äô**. **BIQ** stands for **_Behavior, Impact and Question_**. The BIQ method is super useful for both performance reviews and informal feedback conversations.

- **Behavior**: What did you actually see? Don't make assumptions about intent.
- **Impact statement**: What was the consequence? Why does it matter and who was affected?
- **Question**: What question do you want to ask to open the dialog?

Focussing on specific behaviors reduces ambiguity, sharing the impact gives understanding, and asking a question opens the dialog for real change to happen.

### So you've planned your feedback and you're ready to share it, but is it the right time for them?

**Rule of thumb:** When it comes to feedback, especially redirecting feedback, avoid surprises.

**The fix:** ask permission first.

Asking permission gives others a say in when they receive feedback. This has several benefits:
- Prepares them to be open to your feedback
- Shows your intention is to help
- Ensures enough time and space for a full conversation

When you ask for permission, be specific about what you'd like to share. For example:
- ‚ÄúCan I share some feedback with you about our meeting earlier today?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDo you have 10 minutes today to debrief on the presentation this morning?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI noticed a few things that might improve your presentation. Would you like me to share them with you?‚Äù

To avoid making assumptions, focus on behaviors you can observe. For example:
- ‚ÄúIn the team meeting yesterday, you were giving short answers.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI noticed that you didn't finish that task on time.‚Äù

This makes it much easier for the person to understand what triggered your feedback. It allows them to explain what they were thinking or feeling so you don't have to guess.

### Is it possible to give too much feedback?

Feedback is important for your team's growth, but too much too fast can be overwhelming. It's a lot to take in and makes it harder to act on it in a constructive way.

Counteract this by prioritizing your feedback. Focus on what will have the most impact on people‚Äôs success.

Focusing on 1 or 2 feedback areas at a time will give them space to absorb it and respond constructively.

If you're unsure about what feedback will be most impactful, just ask! For example, before giving feedback on a document, you might ask:
_"Are you looking for feedback on the strategic direction? Or more on spelling and grammar?"_

### Conclusions 

- Communicating data-driven feedback to reinforce or redirect behavior
- Separating the person from the problem to increase openness
- Asking questions to generate a genuine conversation
- Seeking to understand feedback rather than responding defensively.

### Ideas to improve on Feedback

| Title | Description |
| :---:         |          :--- |
|**Hold kick offs and retros**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Ritualize feedback by holding kick offs and retros for every project</p>**Normalize feedback sharing and accelerate team performance by starting all major projects with a kick off.** <p> These sessions where you define project outcomes (including productivity and learning goals).</p><p> Next, schedule your project retrospective, reviewing what went well and what could have been better.</p><p> _Why?_ </p><p>Research on surgical teams shows that taking time to reflect and learn from successes and failures improves performance even more than getting additional practice!</p><p>**Instructions**</p><li>Schedule a 30-90 minute meeting at the start and end of major projects.</li><li>For **kick-off** meetings [use a template](https://github.com/ElizaLo/Product-Management/blob/main/FeedBack/LifeLabs%2BLearning%2BProject%2BKick%2BOff.pdf) to structure.</li><li>For retrospective meetings [use a template](https://github.com/ElizaLo/Product-Management/blob/main/FeedBack/LifeLabs%2BLearning%2BProject%2BRetro.pdf) to structure.</li><li>Invite all stakeholders.</li><li>Explain that your goal is to align on project success, then pause to reflect, share feedback, and extract the learning.</li></ul>|

|**Break up triangulation**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Encourage direct feedback on your team</p><p>**Triangulation happens when someone offers second-hand feedback.**</p><p>This scenario is common among individuals or teams who are not comfortable sharing feedback directly e.g. _"A tells B about something that C did, and B delivers the feedback to C."_ And, if not handled well, triangulation can quickly escalate to distrust, disengagement, and a toxic work culture.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>When a recipient doesn‚Äôt know the feedback source, the message is typically too vague to be helpful. Worse yet, the recipient is often left feeling frustrated and anxious, wondering who said something behind their back and why the message wasn't delivered directly.</p><p>**Instructions**</p><p>Let your team know that you do not support triangulation, and ask everyone to hold one another accountable to giving feedback directly. If someone brings you feedback about someone else:</p><li>**Redirect:** Ask _"Have you shared this feedback directly?"_ If not, ask: _"How can I help you prepare for the conversation?"_ In the case of conflict, offer to mediate the conversation.</li><li>**Credit the source:** If the indivudual is unwilling to share, ask: _"If I deliver this message, can I let the person know they can follow up with you if they have any questions about the feedback?"_</li><li>**Collect the data:** If the individual is still uncomfortable sharing the message, say: _"In that case, I will keep an eye out for this behavior, so I can share the feedback from my perspective."_</li><p>**Pro tip:** [Learn more](https://lifelabslearning.com/lab/tripped-up-by-triangulation-heres-the-right-way-to-handle-third-party-feedback/) about not getting tripped up in triangulation.</p></ul>|
|**Establish feedback norms**|<ul><p> ‚û°Ô∏è Set expectations with your team about how and when to share feedback</p><p>**Share why you think feedback is important.**</p><p>In your next team meeting and in your 1 on 1s, share why you think feedback is important e.g., _"when we give one another feedback, we help each other grow. Being direct about what we think is going well and not so well is the most helpful thing we can do for one another‚Äù_. Invite your team to give you feedback, and ask them to share their feedback preferences. Bonus: ask each direct report what they'd like you to give them feedback on.</p><p>_Why?_</p><p>Feedback expectations vary widely by culture and by individual. Without shared feedback norms, miscommunication and conflict are likely to happen.</p><p>**Instructions**</p><p>At your next team meeting, share your commitment to creating a feedback culture. Ask team members to share their feedback preferences and capture your decisions in a team playbook. For example, answer the questions below together:</p><li>How often should we give one another feedback?</li><li>Should we share feedback in person, over email, Slack, etc.?</li><li>How often should we ask one another for feedback?</li><li>What types of things should we share feedback on?</li><li>How can we make it easy for people to give us feedback?</li><p></p><p>In your 1 on 1 meetings, ask each direct report about their feedback preferences and what they would like you to give them feedback on.</p></ul>|

|[How Google Sold Its Engineers on Management](https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-google-sold-its-engineers-on-management)|High-performing knowledge workers often question whether managers actually contribute much, especially in a technical environment. Until recently, that was the case at Google, a company filled with self-starters who viewed management as more destructive than beneficial and as a distraction from ‚Äúreal work.‚Äù But when Google‚Äôs people analytics team examined the value of managers, applying the same rigorous research methods the company uses in its operations, it proved the skeptics wrong. Mining data from employee surveys, performance reviews, and double-blind interviews, the team verified that managers indeed had a positive impact. It also pinpointed exactly how, identifying the eight key behaviors of great Google managers. In this article, Harvard Business School professor Garvin describes how Google has incorporated the detailed findings from the research into highly specific, concrete guidelines; classes; and feedback reports that help managers hone their essential skills. Because these tools were built from the ground up, using the staff‚Äôs own input, they‚Äôve been embraced by Google employees. Managers say that they‚Äôve found their training to be invaluable, and managers‚Äô ratings from direct reports have steadily risen across the company.|
